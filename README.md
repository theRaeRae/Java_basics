Just playing around with javascript basics. :D

NOTES

DATA TYPES
- There are 8 data types in JS
1. Number - Represents an integer and a float.
2. BigInt - Longer numbers that cannot fit in 64 bits. You can declare an int as a BigInt by adding "n" at the end of the number.
3. String - Words sorrounded by quotes. Can be double, single, or backticks. Double and singles are the same. Backticks have extended functionality. You can embed variables in strings with backticks.
4. Boolean - True or false
5. Null - Does not belong to any data type. Non-existing object.
6. Undefined - Value is not assigned. The variable is declared but not assigned.
7. Object - Complex
8. Symbol - Unique
